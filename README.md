# WinWebConsole

## What is WinWebConsole?

WinWebConsole is my interpretation of the real Windows console, but for the web environment, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the appearance and a few dozen commands, but unfortunately, the web environment does not have access to the computer's file system or the ability to open applications, so some commands like `cd`, `del`, are emulated.

## How to use WinWebConsole?

To use WinWebConsole, you need to open [this website](https://www.dimayastrebov.website/pages/console?lang=en) in your browser. You will see a window similar to a real Windows 11 window with white text. You can use the keyboard to type commands and press Enter to execute them. You can also use the mouse for copying and pasting text.

## What commands are supported?

WinWebConsole supports several basic commands such as `calc`, `cd`, `clear`, `color`, `converter`, `crypt`, `copy`, `curl`, `date`, `del`, `dir`, `echo`, `fact`, `hello`, `help`, `mkdir`, `note`, `password`, `ping`, `random`, `search`, `time`, `timer`, `windows`, `lorem`, `systeminfo`, `ver`, `whoami`, `tasklist`, `taskkill`, `runas`, `type`, `netstat`, `bcdedit`, `gpupdate`, `sfc`, `tree`, `ipconfig`, `error`. You can get a list of all available commands by typing `help`.

## What limitations does WinWebConsole have?

WinWebConsole has several limitations that you should be aware of:

- WinWebConsole does not have access to your real file system or computer resources, as I mentioned earlier.
- WinWebConsole does not support all the features and options of the real Windows console. For example, it does not support input/output redirection, pipes, environment variables, batch files, paths (they do not exist, but you can access them through `cd`), etc.
